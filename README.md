# answer-selection
LSTM-based model for answer selection

This project is based on [LSTM-based Deep Learning Models for Non-factoid Answer Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04108).  
The dataset used is from [Microsoft Beauty of Programming 2017](http://studentclub.msra.cn/bop2017/rules/qualification).  
The word vector used is from https://github.com/Embedding/Chinese-Word-Vectors (Wikipedia_zh 中文维基百科 SGNS word). Download link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AmXYWVgkxrG4GokevPtNgA.  
  
The project achieved arround 52% MRR(Mean Reciprocal Rank) on the validation set.
